# Stop Doomscrolling Website

This is the official website for the **Stop Doomscrolling** project. The website provides information about the project, and serves as a destination page for users when access to a site is blocked by the [Stop Doomscrolling Chrome extension](https://github.com/grumpy-miner/StopDoomscroll-Chrome-Extension).

## Pages

1. **Home Page**: Offers an overview of the Stop Doomscrolling project, including features and screenshots.
2. **Mental Health Resources**: A page providing contact information and help for users who might be struggling with doomscrolling, depression, or other mental health issues.
3. **Blocked Page**: Shown to users after the Chrome extension blocks a site, providing stats on their scrolling behavior and time remaining until they can access the blocked site again.
